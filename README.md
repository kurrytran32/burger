# burger

## INFO
Do you like burgers? I know I do, so welcome to the Burger tracking app!  Here you can keep track of all the burgers you would like to eat, and mark if you've eaten yet or not. 

## TECHNICAL
Using express and mysql npm packages, we are able to store and retrieve user data.  We can also update or delete entries as well.

By using the handlebars package, we are able to dynamically show on the webpage relevant info to the user.
